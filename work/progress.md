# Implementation Progress Log — agent/argon-continue

## Branch & PR Information
- **Branch**: `agent/argon-continue`
- **PR**: #3 (`https://github.com/keshavmittal2203-droid/excel-model-maker/pull/3`)
- **Parent Branch Head**: Branched from Gemini PR #2 / reconciled with `main` and integrated Codex PR #4.

## Milestones Completed

### 1. Codex PR #4 Integration & Governance
- Integrated `docs/TEMPLATE_FIRST.md`, `docs/COURSE_REFERENCE.md`, `template_plan.py`, and `template-workflow/` request templates.
- Enforced proposal segregation: unapproved agent packs moved to `proposals/` (`marksans.model-pack.proposal.json`, `err4.deck-pack.proposal.json`). Removed unapproved packs from repo root.
- Enforced reviewer guards (`DISALLOWED_REVIEWER_TOKENS`) prohibiting agent self-approval. Required `--allow-proposal` flag for testing unapproved candidates.

### 2. Formula Validation & Recalculation Engine
- Hardened formula validation in `modelmaker.py`: strictly checks follower cell coordinates lie within master declared range, rejects reversed ranges (`C3:B2`), enforces master top-left cell match, rejects unexpected formula attributes, and validates required dataTable attributes (`t`, `ref`, `dt2D`, `dtr`, `r1`, `r2`).
- Fixed tolerance evaluation in `validate_workbook.py`: strict check `abs_diff <= abs_tolerance` with no hidden relative fallback bypass.
- Evaluator safety: partial Python formula evaluator explicitly raises `ModelError` on unsupported functions (`FORECAST`) and special formulas rather than silently substituting values.
- Recalculated 17-sheet candidate workbook with native Microsoft Excel COM 16.0:
  - Output: `candidates/Marksans-Recalculated.xlsx` (SHA-256: `9c1fa6e39d88d3bb597de8e4cf6208170471751cb87580aa7c8b6255dd6054e8`)
  - Report: `candidates/Marksans-Validation-Report.json` (19/19 pack checks, 29/29 independent financial identities, 0 errors, 0 stale caches, perturbation and byte-identical restoration confirmed).
  - Status: `recalculated_checks_passed`, `ready: false`, `pending_gates: ["human_pack_approval"]`.

### 3. PowerPoint Composer & Curated Marksans Package
- Hardened `pptmaker.py` with full OOXML engine extensions:
  - Picture replacement (`target_type: "picture_replacement"`): Replaces embedded screenshot images (`<p:pic>`), checks cross-slide sharing safety, and verifies geometry.
  - Native chart data (`target_type: "chart_data"` / `"chart_series"`): Synchronously updates `<c:numCache>`, `<c:strCache>`, `<c:tx>`, and embedded workbook (`xl/worksheets/sheet1.xml` inside `Microsoft_Excel_WorksheetN.xlsx`).
  - Shape suppression (`target_type: "suppress_shape"`): Safely suppresses unverified corporate logos pending authentic brand assets.
  - Curated deck assembly (`retained_slides: [1, 2, 14, 16, 23]`): Re-orders `<p:sldIdLst>`, cleans `presentation.xml.rels`, prunes unreferenced slide parts from package and `[Content_Types].xml`, and preserves exact shape layout.
  - Full DrawingML/Chart XML serialization: Registered complete namespaces (`c`, `a`, `r`, `mc`, `c14`, `c15`, `c16`, `c16r2`, `c16r3`, `p14`, `p15`) preventing XML schema reader failure in PowerPoint.
- Built curated 5-slide research deck proposal in `proposals/err4.deck-pack.proposal.json` and `proposals/err4.inputs.proposal.json` (75 verified slots):
  - Slide 1: Company Profile, Business Model, Brand Portfolio, Product Ecosystem, Strategic Approach; corporate logo suppressed.
  - Slide 2: Executive Summary, Key Highlights; native 5-year Revenue by Segment column chart and FY26 Snapshot chart updated from recalculated workbook.
  - Slide 3 (orig 14): 8-Year Historical Cash Flow Statement (FY18–FY25) and operating cash flow analysis.
  - Slide 4 (orig 16): Comprehensive Ratio Analysis schedule (Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, D/E, ICR, Working Capital Days) and native Current & Quick Ratio trend line charts.
  - Slide 5 (orig 23): WACC & DCF Valuation with bounded high-resolution replacement table pictures (Cost of Equity: Ke=12.26%, Cost of Debt: Kd=5.60%, WACC Schedule: WACC=12.11%).
- Composed candidate deck: `candidates/ERR-4-Marksans-Candidate.pptx`.
- Rendered slide PNG previews (`slide_1.png` to `slide_5.png`) via local PowerPoint COM and 6 worksheet PDFs via Excel COM.
- Visually reviewed rendered slides: confirmed perfect layout alignment, zero text collisions, crisp WACC tables, correct chart lines/bars, and clean logo suppression.
- Manifest status: `status: "composed_pending_render_review"`, `ready: false`, `pending_gates: ["human_pack_approval", "render_review"]`.

### 4. Course Reference Recovery & Provenance Tiering
- Extracted 34-lesson video inventory from live YouTube playlist into `docs/course_lessons.json`.
- Mapped sessions 4–20 directly to the 17 sheets in `Marksans Keshav.xlsx` in `docs/COURSE_REFERENCE.md`.
- Established explicit 3-tier provenance definitions: Playlist Metadata (verified externally), Inferred Sheet Mappings (deduced from titles/indices), and Transcript-Verified Rules (blocked pending human transcription).

### 5. Verification & Test Suite
- `python verify_sources.py`: All 6 original template hashes verified byte-for-byte.
- `python -m unittest -v`: 49/49 tests passing cleanly across modelmaker, pptmaker, and reportmaker (including new regression tests for picture replacement, chart data caching, shape suppression, and retained-slides assembly).
