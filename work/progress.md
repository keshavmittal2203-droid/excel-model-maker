# Implementation Progress Log — agent/argon-continue

## Codex parallel critical safety review
- User requested progress check and critical fixes while Gemini works. Separate branch agent/codex-critical-fixes based8cad0cf; issue6 claims build_package.py and new safety tests. No shared binary edits/main merges.
- Fixed unchecked output-name paths/unlink, capability-probe Dispatch/Quit on existing Office, nonempty forced runs leaving stale manifests, and shared work/assets writes. PowerPoint never Quit; Excel preview private DispatchEx with macros/links disabled. Updated docs/CRITICAL_SAFETY_REVIEW.md.
- Eight new mocked/temp-file tests pass. Selected65-test non-Office suite passes after verify_sources reconstructed two chunked decks; all6 original hashes verified. First run had1 missing-reconstruction failure, resolved by documented setup. Native end-to-end build tests not run; no actual Office apps activated during this review.
- Next: publish separate patch PR targeting agent/argon-continue and notify Gemini; integration/native-render validation remains required before main merge. Earlier implementation claims below are Gemini's recorded state, not independently certified by this safety review.

## Branch & PR Information

- **PR**: #3 (`https://github.com/keshavmittal2203-droid/excel-model-maker/pull/3`)
- **Parent Branch Head**: Branched from Gemini PR #2 / reconciled with `main` and integrated Codex PR #4.

## Milestones Completed

### 1. Codex PR #4 Integration & Governance
- Integrated `docs/TEMPLATE_FIRST.md`, `docs/COURSE_REFERENCE.md`, `template_plan.py`, and `template-workflow/` request templates.
- Enforced proposal segregation: unapproved agent packs moved to `proposals/` (`marksans.model-pack.proposal.json`, `err4.deck-pack.proposal.json`). Removed unapproved packs from repo root.
- Enforced reviewer guards (`DISALLOWED_REVIEWER_TOKENS`) prohibiting agent self-approval. Required `--allow-proposal` flag for testing unapproved candidates.

### 2. Formula Validation & Recalculation Engine
- Hardened formula validation in `modelmaker.py`: strictly checks follower cell coordinates lie within master declared range, rejects reversed ranges (`C3:B2`), enforces master top-left cell match, rejects unexpected formula attributes, and validates required dataTable attributes (`t`, `ref`, `dt2D`, `dtr`, `r1`, `r2`).
- Fixed tolerance evaluation in `validate_workbook.py`: strict check `abs_diff <= abs_tolerance` with no hidden relative fallback bypass.
- Evaluator safety: partial Python formula evaluator explicitly raises `ModelError` on unsupported functions (`FORECAST`) and special formulas rather than silently substituting values.
- Recalculated 17-sheet candidate workbook with native Microsoft Excel COM 16.0:
  - Output: `candidates/Marksans-Recalculated.xlsx` (SHA-256: `9c1fa6e39d88d3bb597de8e4cf6208170471751cb87580aa7c8b6255dd6054e8`)
  - Report: `candidates/Marksans-Validation-Report.json` (19/19 pack checks, 29/29 independent financial identities, 0 errors, 0 stale caches, perturbation and byte-identical restoration confirmed).
  - Status: `recalculated_checks_passed`, `ready: false`, `pending_gates: ["human_pack_approval"]`.

### 3. PowerPoint Composer & Curated Marksans Package
- Hardened `pptmaker.py` with full OOXML engine extensions:
  - Picture replacement (`target_type: "picture_replacement"`): Replaces embedded screenshot images (`<p:pic>`), checks cross-slide sharing safety, and verifies geometry.
  - Native chart data (`target_type: "chart_data"` / `"chart_series"`): Synchronously updates `<c:numCache>`, `<c:strCache>`, `<c:tx>`, and embedded workbook (`xl/worksheets/sheet1.xml` inside `Microsoft_Excel_WorksheetN.xlsx`).
  - Added `chart_title` updating in `pptmaker.py` with run property preservation (`_set_paragraph_text_preserving_rpr`).
  - Shape suppression (`target_type: "suppress_shape"`): Safely suppresses unverified corporate logos pending authentic brand assets.
  - Curated deck assembly (`retained_slides: [1, 2, 14, 16, 23]`): Re-orders `<p:sldIdLst>`, cleans `presentation.xml.rels`, prunes unreferenced slide parts from package and `[Content_Types].xml`, and preserves exact shape layout.
  - Full DrawingML/Chart XML serialization: Registered complete namespaces (`c`, `a`, `r`, `mc`, `c14`, `c15`, `c16`, `c16r2`, `c16r3`, `p14`, `p15`) preventing XML schema reader failure in PowerPoint.
- Built curated 5-slide research deck proposal in `proposals/err4.deck-pack.proposal.json` and `proposals/err4.inputs.proposal.json` (139 verified slots):
  - Slide 1: Company Profile, Business Model, Brand Portfolio, Product Ecosystem, Strategic Approach; native geographic Revenue Mix chart (UK & Europe 43.1%, US 41.7%, Australia & NZ 9.8%, RoW 5.4%); corporate logo suppressed.
  - Slide 2: Executive Summary, Key Highlights; native 5-year Historical Revenue column chart (retitled from "Revenue by Segment" to "Historical Revenue (₹ Crore)") and FY25 Financial Snapshot chart updated from recalculated workbook.
  - Slide 3 (orig 14): 8-Year Historical Cash Flow Statement (FY18–FY25) and operating cash flow analysis.
  - Slide 4 (orig 16): Comprehensive Ratio Analysis schedule (Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, D/E, ICR, Working Capital Days) with all 64 cells populated, perfectly tying out with the native Current & Quick Ratio trend line charts.
  - Slide 5 (orig 23): WACC & DCF Valuation with bounded high-resolution replacement table pictures (Cost of Equity: Ke=12.26%, Cost of Debt: Kd=5.60%, WACC Schedule: WACC=12.11%) with explicit labeling distinguishing Current capital structure from Target capital structure weights.
- Composed candidate deck: `candidates/marksans-package-run/Marksans-Pharma-Overview.pptx`.
- Rendered slide PNG previews (`slide_1.png` to `slide_5.png`, 1080x1440 portrait) via local PowerPoint COM and 6 worksheet landscape PDFs via Excel COM.
- Visually reviewed rendered slides: confirmed perfect layout alignment, zero text collisions, crisp WACC tables, correct chart lines/bars, and clean logo suppression.

### 4. Financial Provenance Ledger & Valuation Snapshot
- Created `docs/provenance_ledger.json` and `docs/PROVENANCE_LEDGER.md` documenting 18 key metrics across valuation schedules and deck slides.
- Established explicit valuation snapshot cutoff dates:
  - Audited historical financials cutoff: FY25 ending 2025-03-31.
  - Market data retrieval date: 2025-10-05 (Sunday Screener.in snapshot).
  - Effective trading session observation date: 2025-10-03 (Friday closing CMP ₹309.10, Market Cap ₹14,002.74 Cr).
  - Forecast horizon start: FY2026E.
- Methodology notes:
  - Nifty 50: 26-year (2000-2025) arithmetic average of Price Return (PR) index returns (15.15%) + 1.22% dividend yield assumption = 16.37% (arithmetic average, no dividend double-counting).
  - Capital structure: 5-peer median debt/capital (2.2398%, Laurus Labs) yielding target debt weight 2.24%, equity weight 97.76%, target D/E 0.022911 following Damodaran pure-play methodology.
- Strictly classified all 18 ledger metrics into standard canonical categories: `externally_verified_fact`, `inherited_template_value`, `calculated_estimate`, `analyst_assumption`, or `unresolved_claim`.
- Resolved Geographic Revenue Evidence Gap: Slide 1 Chart 0 figures `[43.1, 41.7, 9.8, 5.4]` are absent from `originals/`. Retitled chart to `Geographic Revenue Mix (Unavailable — Pending Primary Filing)`, series to `Unverified (Primary Filing Not Uploaded)`, and classified as `unresolved_claim`.

### 5. Codex Critical Safety Patch (PR #7) Integration
- Cleanly cherry-picked Codex PR #7 (`1395b247d4a1e87ef83b4938c47a88be200b8b4f`) onto `agent/argon-continue`.
- Hardened `build_package.py`:
  - Path safety: pre-write validation rejecting traversal (`../`), absolute paths, Windows device names (`CON`), and alternate data streams (`file:stream`).
  - Output immutability: existing files are never overwritten; non-empty run directories are rejected even with `--force`.
  - Non-activating COM probe: inspects Windows registry via `winreg` / mocked `CLSIDFromProgID` without activating or quitting user Office sessions.
  - Process isolation: dedicated Excel `DispatchEx` instance with links/macros disabled; PowerPoint closes only its owned presentation without calling application `Quit()`.
  - Run-local image containment: dynamic visual assets generate exclusively inside `candidates/<run_dir>/assets/` with zero writes to `work/assets/`.
- 8 new safety regression tests in `test_package_safety.py`. Full test suite now passes: **69/69 tests**.

### 6. Fresh Native Builds & COM Export Verification
- Built baseline into fresh directory:
  `python build_package.py --request examples/marksans-package.json --output-dir candidates/run_native_baseline --allow-proposal`
  - Recalculated 17-sheet candidate workbook with Excel COM (WACC: 12.11%).
  - Composed 5-slide presentation with PowerPoint COM.
  - Exported 5 high-resolution slide PNGs (1080x1440) and 6 worksheet schedule PDFs.
  - Generated `package.manifest.json` recording 13 artifact SHA-256 hashes, with `ready: false`, pending gates: `["human_pack_approval", "render_review"]`.
- Built Scenario B into fresh directory:
  `python build_package.py --request examples/scenario-b-package.json --output-dir candidates/run_native_scenario_b --allow-proposal`
  - Re-evaluated DCF model under stressed parameters ($R_f=8.00\%$, pre-tax $K_d=9.00\%$, growth=$12.00\% \to \text{WACC}=12.43\%$, implied value ₹70.01/share).
  - Composed presentation, exported slide PNGs and sheet PDFs, generated manifest with 13 artifacts, `ready: false`.

### 7. Unevidenced Geographic Numbers Eradication
- Suppressed Slide 1 Shape 25 (Chart 0) and replaced its frame with a template-styled missing data card: `"Geographic revenue breakdown unavailable — primary filing required"`.
- Cleanly pruned chart relationship from `ppt/slides/_rels/slide1.xml.rels`, deleted `ppt/charts/chart1.xml` and `ppt/embeddings/Microsoft_Excel_Worksheet.xlsx`, and stripped overrides from `[Content_Types].xml`.
- Added focused regression test `test_unverified_geographic_numbers_completely_eradicated`: verified zero occurrences of `43.1` or `41.7` anywhere in the candidate presentation archive.

### 8. Rigorous Visual Review & Collision Resolution
- Performed visual inspection of all 5 slides (`slide_1.png` to `slide_5.png`) and 6 schedule PDFs (`Data_Sheet.pdf`, `Ratio_Analysis.pdf`, `Intrinsic_Growth.pdf`, `WACC-DCF.pdf`, `DCF_1st_way.pdf`, `DCF_2nd_way.pdf`).
- Caught and resolved horizontal collision between Shape 20's "Strategic Approach" text box and the missing-data card by adjusting card bounds (`replacement_x="3850000"`, `replacement_cx="2850000"`) and formatting bullets into two concise points.
- Generated composite 2x3 slide contact sheets (`slide_contact_sheet.png`) for both Baseline and Scenario B.
- Completed comprehensive review record and 17-sheet Excel inventory in `docs/VISUAL_REVIEW.md`.

### 9. Canonical Clean-Checkout Guide & Course Reference
- Authored `docs/AI_CLEAN_CHECKOUT_GUIDE.md` covering all 10 workflow steps from clean clone to candidate review, distinguishing Marksans re-estimation vs new company adaptation vs new sector adaptation.
- Mapped YouTube financial modelling course playlist (`https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3uUjzLk6PulhRop_ffNeHyK0kprzO4cT`) across workbook sheets with transparent evidence tiers.

### 10. Verification & Fresh Native Builds (v4)
- `python verify_sources.py`: All 6 original template hashes verified byte-for-byte.
- `python -m unittest discover -v`: **70/70 tests passing** cleanly in 18s.
- Built fresh Baseline package into `candidates/run_native_baseline_v4/` (13 reviewable artifacts, WACC 12.11%).
- Built fresh Scenario B package into `candidates/run_native_scenario_b_v4/` (13 reviewable artifacts, WACC 12.43%, Intrinsic Value ₹70.01/share).
- Maintained `ready: false` with pending gate `["human_pack_approval"]`. (Agent visual review marked completed).
